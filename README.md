This project investigates the use of a CNN model to classify three types of red fruits: cherries, strawberries, and tomatoes. 
The primary objectives include exploring CNN functionality in comparison with a basic MLP, optimising model parameters for this classification task, and identifying the most effective loss function and optimiser. 
Additionally, the study aims to evaluate model accuracy across the three fruit categories, analyse error types and frequency, and assess generalisability on unseen images. 
Computational efficiency, measured in terms of resource usage and time, is also considered to determine the model's applicability with small to medium-scale classification tasks.
